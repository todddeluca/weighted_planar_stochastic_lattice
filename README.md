## Introduction

![Weighted Stochastic Planar Lattice](./weighted_planar_stochastic_lattice_400.png)

Weighted planar stochastic lattices look awesome! Surely the world needs videos of them being constructed.

- This video, generated by `playground.ipynb`, shows how this method constructs these lattices: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alE77jzp8vo
